problem:
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1
1 <= pick <= n


approach :
the problem is that we have to search for the picked number from range 1 to n including n.
there a function guess() that is given to us. We can use this function to check if the guessed number is right.
brute force: linear search 
O(n)
better approach: binary search
O(logn)

code:
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        left=0
        right=n
        while(left<=right):
            m=left+(right-left)//2
            if(guess(m)==0):
                return m
            elif(guess(m)==-1):
                right=m-1
            else:
                left=m+1
        return
